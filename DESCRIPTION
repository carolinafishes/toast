Description: TOAST, an open source software package of R tools for Linux that can utilize the ortholog searches based 
             on the software Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) to assemble multiple sequence alignments 
             of orthologous loci from transcriptomes for any group of organisms. By streamlining search, query, and assembly, 
             TOAST automates the generation of locus and concatenated alignments, and also presents a series of outputs from 
             which users can explore missing data patterns across their alignments.
